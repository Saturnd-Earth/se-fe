<ul>
    <li>Saturn'd Earth is a social media application that captures the user's latitude and longitude and displays a ring on the map where the post was made. If anyone near the post "likes" the post the ring will grow larger and this can happen until the post makes a ring around the Earth and the Earth becomes "Saturn'd"</li>
</ul>
